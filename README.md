🌱 Smart Plant Box

The Smart Plant Box is an automated self-watering system designed to keep your plants healthy without constant monitoring. Using real-time soil moisture readings, the system automatically activates a water pump to maintain the optimal moisture level for your plants.

This project is ideal for beginner gardeners or anyone with a busy schedule who wants their plants to thrive with minimal effort.

🚀 Features

Automatic Watering: Keeps soil moisture at an ideal level using sensor feedback.

Real-Time Monitoring: Displays live moisture, temperature, and humidity data on an OLED screen.

Energy Efficient: Runs on a rechargeable battery pack for portable or outdoor use.

User Friendly: Easy setup with Arduino and simple C++ interface for data visualization or control.

🧠 How It Works

The moisture sensor measures the soil’s water content.

The Arduino reads this sensor data and compares it to a preset threshold.

When the soil is too dry, the water pump activates until the desired moisture level is restored.

The temperature and humidity sensor tracks the environment, helping users understand external factors that affect plant health.

The OLED display shows real-time readings of soil moisture, temperature, and humidity.
