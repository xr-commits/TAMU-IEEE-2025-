The Smart Plant Box keeps the water level in the soil at a level that ensures the plant(s) inside will survive. A moisture sensor measures the water level in the soil and sends a signal to a pump to keep the water level stable. This device is useful for beginner gardeners and people who don't have a lot of time to keep track of a plant.
